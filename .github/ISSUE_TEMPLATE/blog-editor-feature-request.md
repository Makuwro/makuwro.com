## The workarounds

<!--
Have you tried any alternatives to your proposal? If not, just erase this entire category. 
Example: "I can use the source editor and wrap the text with a span tag, attach a class to it, and modify my custom CSS."

What are the disadvantages to these workarounds? 
Example: "This alternative is too tedious in comparison to having a simple button on the blog editor itself."
